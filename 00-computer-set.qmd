*Plan for about 20 minutes to install the necessary software for the workshop. This can be completed on your own before the workshop or during check-in from 12:45-1:15 in person at the event* 

**Laptop Requirement:** You must bring your own Windows or MacOS laptop with at least 4GB of RAM. Also bring a charging cord and a mouse if you like using one.

**If any any point you get stuck or something is not working as expeceted take a screen shot or copy/paste the text you see into ChatGPT and ask for help troubleshooting. If something is still not working then send an email to [strategy-program@byu.edu](mailto:strategy-program@byu.edu) for assistance.**

### Install Claude Code from the Terminal

Now you’ll install the **Claude Code CLI (command-line interface)**,  this tool connects VS Code directly to Claude.

Run **one** of the following commands inside the VS Code terminal, depending on your operating system:

- [ ] Copy and paste this command into the terminal, then press **Enter**:

**On Windows**

  ```bash
  irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

**On macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

- [ ] Once installation finishes, check that it worked by typing into the terminal and pressing **Enter**:

```bash
claude --version
```
- [ ] Confirm you see output similar to:

```bash
2.0.31 (Claude Code)
```

- [ ] Start-up Claude Code by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
claude
```

You will be prompted to authenticate that you have a Claude Pro account and will routed to a web-brower tab where you will sign into Claude. Once complete, return to VS Code and you should see something like:

Congratulations! Now that you have Claude Code successfully installed, you now how a new superpower on your computer which we will use to help us install a number of other softwares we will need to build full-stack applications and get AI leverage on many other knowledge work tasks. 

Let's use this new superpower to install a number of other softwares we will need through out the workshop. Claude Code will help you complete the rest of the installations. Paste the following prompt into the terminal where Claude Code is active:

> Please help me to install the following softwares or confirm they are already installed: 1) git, 2) node, 3) python

Press **Enter** to say "Yes" when asked to proceed. Claude Code functions basically like a normal chat bot and will make the remaining installations with your approval.

> **Note on Using the Terminal**
>
> The terminal isn’t quite like a normal text editor, you **can’t click anywhere in a line to move your cursor or edit text**.  
> Instead, use the **arrow keys** on your keyboard to move left and right within the command you’re typing.  
> If you make a mistake, you can use:
>
> - **Backspace** (Windows) or **Delete** (Mac) to erase characters  
> - **↑ (up arrow)** to recall your last command  
> - **↓ (down arrow)** to move forward through your command history  

**You are now ready to begin the workshop!** However, in addition to Claude Code, there are several other AI agents that you should install if you have accounts with other AI providers. The workshop instruction will be with Claude Code but we will refer to other AI agents as well and demonstrate how these can be used.

You may optionally run the following commands from a new terminal window or from within an active Claude Code terminal in which case Claude will ask you for permission and then execute these commands for you.

**Gemini CLI from Google**

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

**GitHub Copilot from Microsoft** 

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

**Codex from OpenAI (ChatGPT) Copilot (Microsoft)** 

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

After installation you can run the following commands to active each of these agents by running a terminal command within VS Code as you did for Claude Code.

```bash
gemini
```

```bash
copilot
